# userbot_tg
Create a script for the user who calls the participants. Without the server! Unlike the usual bot, the userâ€™s script is executed from the account of a real person, for example - from your account.
For use it is necessary: 
- Internet connection; 
- Account telegram (number + code); 
- Python (+ Pip); 
- Telethon, asyncio and other libraries.
